    <div class="mb-12">
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research focuses on the performance, evaluation, and
        preservation of highway bridges, with an emphasis on
        prestressed concrete and composite steel–concrete systems.
        I combine field inspections, load testing, and deck
        condition assessment with analytical modeling to better
        understand how real bridges behave under service and
        extreme loads.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        At The University of Texas at Arlington, I have worked on
        multiple TxDOT bridge projects, including precast element
        fabrication inspection, non-destructive testing of bridge
        decks using GPR and Impact Echo, in-service load testing,
        and load rating. These field measurements are integrated
        with analytical tools such as CSiBridge, PGSuper, and
        finite-element models to calibrate design assumptions,
        identify reserve capacity, and support practical
        recommendations for maintenance, strengthening, and
        replacement.

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The overarching goal of my work is to provide transportation
      agencies with practical, data-driven tools for making better
      decisions about bridge safety, serviceability, and life-cycle
      cost. By combining rigorous field testing with advanced
      structural modeling, my research helps reduce uncertainty in
      load ratings, extend the useful life of existing bridges, and
      support more efficient use of construction and maintenance
      budgets—ultimately contributing to safer and more resilient
      infrastructure for the traveling public.
